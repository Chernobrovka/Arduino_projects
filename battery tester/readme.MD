1. Read the value of this import.
2. Increase the read value by a factor of 0.0048 to get
voltage in volts.
3. If the voltage is or more than 1.6 V, it turns on for a short section
green LED.
4. If the voltage is 1.4 V and less than 1.6 V, turn on the yellow LED for a short period.
5. If the voltage is less than 1.4 V, a short section of red is turned on
Light-emitting diode.
6. Repeat to infinity.
